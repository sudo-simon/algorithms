# My algorithms implementations

Implementations of the most notable computer science algorithms with some form of visualization.
Some data structures have been implemented too for various purposes.
The programming language used may vary according to what I feel like working on in that particular context.

## Currently implemented algorithms

- [Dijkstra](./dijkstra/)

## Currently implemented data structures

- [Heap](./Structs/heap/)

## How to use

- **Java programs**
    must be executed from this main folder with 
    ```sh
    java <packagename>.<Classname> <args>
    ```
    where packagename is the folder name and Classname is the same as the folder name but capitalized.

Every program has a "--help" argument that can be passed, if passed alone, that explains how it works.
